                As most of you know, April will mark the 11-year anniversary of Josh&apos;s untimely
                death from cancer. Most are also aware that he contracted an aggressive form of
                cancer in early 2015 and was gone in 75 days from the time of the diagnosis. He was
                32 — and just taking off in his life.

              <p>
                Josh loved golf, and in fact it was his chosen profession as a certified TPC caddy.
                As a result he built up a dedicated group of customers who responded to his cheerful
                attitude and hustling style. Many of them are joining us for this tournament.
              </p>
              <p>
                Josh loved The First Tee and what it provides to kids who have never experienced
                golf before. He often would comment on how it reminded him of when he first started
                playing at eight years old. It was a love affair that never ended.

                As we have had the pleasure of knowing many of you a lifetime — and many of you just
                a few short years — our relationships have been brokered on common interest,
                professional business, neighborly kindness, athletics, and FUN. But most of all they
                are meaningful relations that have represented collaboration, creativity, and above
                all appreciation.
              </p>
              <p>
                We would love for you to join us in Arizona on the 6th of June, as available, to
                enjoy a round of golf and fun as we again pay tribute to Josh.
