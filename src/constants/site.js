// footer stay strictly page-based. Privacy & Terms link to SOP-required
// URL paths and live in the footer's legal row.
//
// Three-path CTA architecture: Register / Sponsor / Donate replace the
// single "Registration" entry. /registration still resolves and remains
// reachable as the full catalog from deep links inside each page.
// "Photos" is dropped from primary nav and lives as a cross-link on /about.
